Al Haramain Perfumes & Thawbs E-Commerce Web Application

1.0 Introduction

Al Haramain Perfumes & Thawbs is a student-run business operating inside IIUM, specializing in high-quality alcohol-free perfumes and traditional thawbs. Their current selling method depends heavily on in-person contact, WhatsApp communication, and manual stock tracking, making it difficult to scale or reach customers efficiently.

This project transforms the business into a fully functional Laravel MVC e-commerce platform, complete with product listings, an admin dashboard, user authentication, a shopping cart, order management, and a checkout system.

Our goal is to create a seamless, Shariah-compliant online shopping experience that reflects the brand identity of Al Haramain while solving real operational problems the business faces.

The platform is developed using Laravel, ensuring high security, scalability, clean architecture, and long-term maintainability.

2.0 Problem Statement

Inefficient Order Processing
Seller must meet customers, track orders manually, and send confirmations one by one.
